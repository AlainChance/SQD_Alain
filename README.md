## Clone the repository `SQD_Alain`
`git clone https://github.com/AlainChance/SQD_Alain`

# Setup your own SQD simulation with the Jupyter notebook [SQD_Alain.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/SQD_Alain/blob/main/SQD_Alain.ipynb) 
Set up the configuration with the Gradio user interface. 

## Loading a configuration from a Json file
To load a configuration enter its name in the field `Json configuration filename` and then click on the button **Load configuration from a Json file**. It will update values for all components of the Gradio user interface.

The field `Json configuration filename` is initialized with the name of first file ending with `.json` in the current directory or `None` if there is none.

## Classical simulation
* Checkbox `run_on_QPU`: leave unticked to perform a classical simulation by loading a bit array file or by generating random samples drawn from the uniform distribution.
* Textbox `Load bit array file name (or 'None')`:

  * `None` → generate random samples drawn from the uniform distribution.
  * `bit array file name`, e.g. `N2_ibm_brisbane_bitarray.npy` → load a bit array file from a previous run.

## Simulation on a real QPU
* Checkbox `run_on_QPU`: ticked to perform a simulation on a real QPU.
* Dropdown listbox `Select IBM Backend Name (or 'None' for least busy)`: select `None` or a real backend name.

Click on the button **Save SQD configuration into a Json file and run simulation**.

The configuration is automatically saved into a Json configuration file, see for exemple: [SQD_CH2_Triplet.json](https://github.com/AlainChance/SQD_Alain/blob/main/CH2_Triplet/SQD_CH2_Triplet.json).

## Status window
The status window displays error messages and the following information at the end of a successful simulation:
* SQD configuration saved into (Json configuration file name) and simulation complete.
* Exact energy: Ha
* SQD energy: Ha
* Absolute error: Ha

## Plot energy and occupancy window
* The first plot shows an estimation of the ground state energy within $\approx$ `1 milli-Hartree (mHa)`. The usual chemical accuracy is typically defined as `1 kcal/mol` $\approx$ `1.6 mHa`. However in the context of quantum chemistry, chemical accuracy is often approximated as `1 mHa`. The estimation of the energy can be improved by drawing more samples from the circuit, increasing the number of samples per batch and increasing the number of iterations.

* The second plot shows the average occupancy of each spatial orbital after the final iteration.

# What is SQD?
“Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a chemistry simulation technique that uses the quantum computer to extract a noisy distribution of possible electronic configurations of a molecule in the form of bitstrings. 

Then, it runs an iterative correction entirely on a classical computer to cluster these bitstrings around the correct electron configuration. 

This technique, for a large enough noisy quantum computer with low enough error rates, has the potential to perform more efficiently than classical approximation methods.”

## SQD process using Qiskit patterns
Using the [Qiskit patterns](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/intro-to-patterns) framework, the SQD process can be described in four steps, Ref. [arXiv:2405.05068
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068):

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Step} &\text{Purpose} &\text{Method}\\
\hline
\text{1} &\text{Map classical inputs to a quantum problem} &\text{Generate an ansatz for estimating the ground state}\\
\hline
\text{2} &\text{Optimize problem for quantum execution} &\text{Transpile the ansatz for the backend}\\
\hline
\text{3} &\text{Execute experiments using Qiskit Primitives} &\text{Draw samples from the ansatz using the Sampler primitive}\\
\hline
\text{4} &\text{Post-process and return results to desired classical format} &\text{Self-consistent configuration recovery loop}\\
\hline
\end{array}$$

## Self-consistent configuration recovery procedure
The probabilistic self-consistent configuration recovery is an iterative procedure that runs in a loop which comprises the following steps:
- Post-process the full set of bitstring samples, using prior knowledge of particle number and the average orbital occupancy calculated on the most recent iteration.
- Probabilistically create batches of subsamples from recovered bitstrings.
- Project and diagonalize the molecular Hamiltonian over each sampled subspace.
- Save the minimum ground state energy found across all batches and update the average orbital occupancy.

## SQD workflow
The SQD workflow with self-consistent configuration recovery is depicted in the following diagram.

![SQD diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd/7fcec2a686bfe115560db20b840cf2b185ae06f6/docs/_static/images/sqd_diagram.png)

Source: [Improving energy estimation of a chemistry Hamiltonian with SQD](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd/blob/main/docs/tutorials/01_chemistry_hamiltonian.ipynb)

## Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem
We perform a CCSD calculation. The [t1 and t2 amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_cluster#Cluster_operator) from this calculation will be used to initialize the parameters of the `LUCJ` ansatz circuit.

We use [ffsim](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ffsim) to create the ansatz circuit. ffsim is a software library for simulating fermionic quantum circuits that conserve particle number and the Z component of spin. This category includes many quantum circuits used for quantum chemistry simulations. By exploiting the symmetries and using specialized algorithms, ffsim can simulate these circuits much faster than a generic quantum circuit simulator.

Depending on the number of unpaired electrons, we use either:
* the spin-balanced variant of the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz, ffsim class [UCJOpSpinBalanced](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/api/ffsim.html#ffsim.UCJOpSpinBalanced).
* the spin-unbalanced variant of the unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz, ffsim class [UCJOpSpinUnbalanced](https://qiskit-community.github.io/ffsim/api/ffsim.html#ffsim.UCJOpSpinUnbalanced).

## Step 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution
Next, we optimize the circuit for a target hardware. We generate a staged pass manager using the [generate\_preset\_pass\_manager](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_preset#generate_preset_pass_manager) function from qiskit with the specified `backend` and `initial_layout`.

We set the `pre_init` stage of the staged pass manager to `ffsim.qiskit.PRE_INIT`. It includes qiskit transpiler passes that decompose gates into orbital rotations and then merges the orbital rotations, resulting in fewer gates in the final circuit.

## Step 3: Execute using Qiskit Primitives
There are two options:
* Classical simulation by generating random samples drawn from the uniform distribution. See [A case against uniform sampling](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/quantum-diagonalization-algorithms/sqd-overview#32-a-case-against-uniform-sampling).
* Simulation on a real QPU.

## Step 4: Post-process and return result to desired classical format
The first iteration of the self-consistent configuration recovery procedure uses the raw samples, after post-selection on symmetries, as input to the diagonalization process to obtain an estimate of the average orbital occupancies.

Subsequent iterations use these occupancies to generate new configurations from raw samples that violate the symmetries (i.e., are incorrect). These configurations are collected and then subsampled to produce batches, which are subsequently used to project the Hamiltonian and compute a ground-state estimate using an eigenstate solver.

We use the `diagonalize_fermionic_hamiltonian` function defined in [qiskit-addon-sqd/qiskit\_addon\_sqd/fermion.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd/blob/main/qiskit_addon_sqd/fermion.py).

The solver included in the `SQD addon` uses PySCF's implementation of selected CI, specifically [pyscf.fci.selected_ci.kernel_fixed_space](https://pyscf.org/pyscf_api_docs/pyscf.fci.html#pyscf.fci.selected_ci.kernel_fixed_space)

The following parameters of the `SQD class` are user-tunable:
* `max_iterations`: Limit on the number of configuration recovery iterations.
* `num_batches`: The number of batches of configurations to subsample (i.e., the number of separate calls to the eigenstate solver).
* `samples_per_batch`: The number of unique configurations to include in each batch.
* `max_cycles`: The maximum number of Davidson cycles run by the eigenstate solver.
* `occupancies_tol`: Numerical tolerance for convergence of the average orbital occupancies. If the maximum change in absolute value of the average occupancy of an orbital between iterations is smaller than this value, then the configuration recovery loop will exit, if the energy has also converged (see the ``energy_tol`` argument).
* `energy_tol`: Numerical tolerance for convergence of the energy. If the change in energy between iterations is smaller than this value, then the configuration recovery loop will exit, if the occupancies have also converged (see the ``occupancies_tol`` argument).

The first plot shows an estimation of the ground state energy within $\approx$ `1 milli-Hartree (mHa)`. The usual chemical accuracy is typically defined as `1 kcal/mol` $\approx$ `1.6 mHa`. However in the context of quantum chemistry, chemical accuracy is often approximated as `1 mHa`. The estimation of the energy can be improved by drawing more samples from the circuit, increasing the number of samples per batch and increasing the number of iterations.

The second plot shows the average occupancy of each spatial orbital after the final iteration. Both the spin-up and spin-down electrons occupy the first eight orbitals with high probability.

The first excited state $CH_2$ is called a carbene singlet state, where the two electrons in the carbon atom are paired and one orbital is empty. In a singlet state, the two electrons are paired with opposite spins, resulting in a total spin of zero.

## Configuration

* `spin`: `2`
* `basis`: `6-31G`
* `Symmetry`: `True`
* `Number of frozen orbitals`:  `0`
* `max_iterations`: `10`.

We set `spin` to `2`, the number of unpaired electrons of a molecule. Spin symmetrization will not be performed because the number of alpha and beta electrons is unequal. The [SQD](https://github.com/AlainChance/SQD_Alain/blob/main/SQD_Alain.py) class automatically sets `symmetrize_spin = False` when the PySCF `spin` option is not zero.

The PySCF atom configuration gives the following:
* Bond length $C–H$ ≈ 1.116 Å (first H) and ≈ 1.01 Å (second H), depending on the method.
* $H–C–H$ angle ≈ 135°, reflecting the open-shell triplet nature.
* The geometry is asymmetric, with one hydrogen atom out of the molecular plane—this reflects the true triplet ground state ($^3B_1$) of $CH_2$.
